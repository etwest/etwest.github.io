## Graduate Research Day
Graduate Research Day is an event put on by the Stony Brook Computer Science Department in which graduate students (primarily Ph.D. students) present their research to peers and a panel of judges. Students submit posters to present and some are selected to give talks. The day is divided into talk sessions, the poster presentation, and an awards ceremony. Awards are given to the best overall talk and poster, and to the best posters and talks within subject areas (Systems, ML, or Theory).

I was selected to give a talk and my talk was selected as the best theory presentation.
